### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Elie Annestay and here's a few things about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a css library between bootstrap and neumorphism called Neostrap, my current progress on it is accessible on my Neostrap repo. Modifying my ender 3v2 to use a syringe with some custom parts that will be available someday. Also working on a Linear regression librairy in C.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript, after that I will getback to React/React Native. I will also learn more about C and hopefully finish my linear regression librairy. On other topics, I'm learning about bioplastics and will get back to experimenting with chitosan and Polylactic Acid.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a language learning app using react native.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with css animations, most of React/React Native.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything that might interest me.
